üß† **Understanding Your Pattern**

You're not broken - your brain is trying to protect you. When you face challenging code, 
your stress response triggers task-switching as a relief valve.

**What's happening:**
- Difficult task ‚Üí Cortisol spike
- Brain seeks relief ‚Üí Switch apps
- Temporary comfort ‚Üí Return to task
- Cycle repeats

**Better alternatives:**
1. **Box Breathing**: 4 seconds in, 4 hold, 4 out, 4 hold
2. **Micro-walk**: 30 seconds away from screen
3. **Progress celebration**: Acknowledge small wins

Try this: Next time you feel the switch urge, pause and take 3 deep breaths first.
